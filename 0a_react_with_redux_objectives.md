In the last course section, we covered the basics of building a React application and managing state. In a smaller application like our Help Queue, we can manage our shared and local state without using external libraries.

In this course section, we will learn to use **Redux**, a library that we can use to manage shared state in React applications. We will learn about the different parts of Redux, including the Redux **store** and **reducers**. Here are the topics we'll cover:

* The basics of Redux, including the store and reducers
* Creating, combining and splitting reducers
* Testing reducers with Jest
* Combining React and Redux using React Redux
* Using action creators and constants
* Component lifecycle methods

## Independent Project Objectives
---

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Redux successfully manages all shared state.
* All Redux reducers are pure functions.
* Jest is used to test all reducers.
* Actions are successfully dispatched to specify changes to state.
* Reducers receive and handle actions to correctly mutate the store's state.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
