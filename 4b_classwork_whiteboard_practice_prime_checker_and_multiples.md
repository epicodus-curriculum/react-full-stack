## Whiteboard Practice
---

When and how whiteboarding practice is implemented will be up to your teacher. Below is a recommended prompt.

### Goal

For this section's whiteboarding lesson, we’ll continue to practice with arrays, looping, and using C#'s basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)

As the interviewee:

* Ask clarifying questions.
* Keep talking.
* Explain your plan at the beginning; recap what you’ve done at the end.
* Make eye contact.
* Plan your space.

As the interviewer:

* Answer questions as best as you can.
* Be encouraging. Whiteboarding is difficult!
* Be patient. Only offer hints if your partner indicates that they need help.
* Be engaged. Part of this practice is getting used to having someone evaluate your work as your produce it.
* Offer _constructive_ feedback. Find at least one thing that your partner did well _and_ one thing they could improve at.

### Problem

**1st Prompt**: Write a method that returns a boolean indicating whether a number is prime. Recall that a number is prime if it is greater than 1 and is not evenly divisible by any other numbers excepting 1 and itself. 

**Examples**:

  * Given: 7, Output: true

  * Given: 2, Output: true

  * Given: 8, Output: false

**2nd Prompt**: Write a method that returns an array of all of the multiples for a given number. A multiple of a given number is a number that can be multiplied by a second number to make the given number. 


**Examples**:

  * Given: 7, Output: [ 1, 7 ]

  * Given: 24, Output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 ]

### Further Exploration

* Write a method that returns an array of all the prime numbers that are less than a given number. 
  * **Examples**:
      * Given: 7, Output: [ 2, 3, 5 ]

      * Given: 2,  Output: [ ]

* Write a method that returns the greatest common multiple (GCM) for two given numbers. The GCM is the largest number that both given numbers are evenly divisible by. 
  * **Examples**:
      * Given: 24, 18, Output: 6

      * Given: 50, 8, Output: 2

      * Given: 25, 5, Output: 5
