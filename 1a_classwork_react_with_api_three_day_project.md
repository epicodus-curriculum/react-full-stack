**Goals:** Build a React application that makes API calls. Follow along with the weekend lessons to make an API call with the `useReducer()` hook, and then a light/dark theme with context. Then spend the remaining class sessions building out a project with your pair or group. This project will utilize your skills with React to consume any API of your choosing.

## Warm Up
---

* At what point in a React component's lifecycle might we make an API call and why?
* When should we prefer to use the `useReducer()` hook versus the `useState()` hook for state management?
* Is context a state management tool? Explain why or why not.
* Name some use cases for context.
* Name alternatives to using context.

## Code

### React with API Calls and Context

Work through the weekend homework to make a React application that makes an API call to the NY Times API. Then implement a light/dark mode in the Help Queue with the use of context.

### Full Stack Project

Spend the next three class sessions building a React application around an API of your choosing. You may create any type of application as long as it uses the following:

* React
* React hooks to manage state
* The Fetch API 

**Note:** If you wish, you may also try React Native, which is designed for mobile development. See the upcoming homework if you are interested.

For a starting list of potential APIs to choose from, take a look at this [repository containing public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

## Peer Code Review
---

* Application parses API response and displays response data in the UI.
* State is managed with hooks.
* React application has detailed README with local deployment instructions and links to other repos related to the project if applicable.
