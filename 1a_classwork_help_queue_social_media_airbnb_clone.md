**Goal:** Get comfortable with the basics of React by following along with this weekend's homework and creating basic applications of your own. Make sure you break each application up into a tree of self-contained components.

## Warm Up
---

* What is the difference between a framework and a library? Which is React? How can you tell?
* What is the virtual DOM? How does React use it? What benefits does it offer?
* Why might a developer choose React over another library or framework? What type of projects do you think are best suited to the React library?

### React Basics & Help Queue

Work through the weekend homework with your partner. Take your time and ensure you and your partner fully understand each step and concept before moving on.

### Social Media Clone

React was originally developed by Facebook to manage the dynamic, complex needs of a large social media app. After observing Facebook's success, many other social media applications have also begun relying on React.

Create a site that looks like the mock-up depicted below using only React components. Take care in determining which portions warrant their own components:

Make sure to draw a component diagram and include it in your README.

### Airbnb Clone

If you're able to complete all exercises above with time to spare, try re-creating [Airbnb's minimal, clean homepage](https://www.airbnb.com/) with React components.

Again, don't worry about functionality. Simply practice the act of breaking a multifaceted user interface into React components.

Make sure to draw a component diagram and include it in your README.

## Peer Code Review

* Components are used to create modular UI elements.
* `propTypes` define data types for all component props.
* Application works as expected.
* Application is well planned and includes a component diagram.
