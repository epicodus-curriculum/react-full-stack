Congratulations! You've made it to the final in-class course section at Epicodus! 

## Overview of the Independent Capstone Course Section
---

You will spend this course section working independently on a cumulative capstone project of your choosing. You will also apply to internships.  On the final day of class, you'll present the project at our in-class trade show. 
This lesson will outline the requirements and expectations for this course section. Check in with your instructor if you have any questions.
 
### Applying to Internships

You will have time set aside during class hours to apply to internships during the Capstone course section. To learn more, read through the lesson:

* [For full-time students](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/react-classic/independent-capstone/career-services-day) 
* [For part-time students](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/react-part-time-evening/independent-capstone-part-2/career-services-day)

If you have any questions, check in with your advisor.

### Review

The previous capstone-related lessons are included in this section for your convenience. Lessons prefixed with "review" are for you to optionally review. These include:

* Review: Final Capstone Project
* Review: Capstone Planning: The Minimum Viable Product
* Review: Independent Capstone Project Proposal
* Review: Pitching Your Capstone

### Requirements

* **You must put in at least 40 hours of work into your capstone by the due date.** The 40 hours comes from the time we provide you to work on your project during class time in this course section and in lieu of regular independent projects for the React with Redux, React with NoSQL, and React with APIs course sections. If you have any questions about this, check in with your instructor.

* **Attendance policy still applies.** You are still expected to attend Epicodus during normal class hours, and sign in and out of Epicenter. If you are an online student, we expect you to be in a voice channel in Discord server during normal class hours.

* **Continue to sign in with a pair.** Even though your capstone requires independent work, you can still support your peers through this process. We encourage you to help each other with bugs or design decisions. 

* **You may use your own machine.** Similar to team week and the independent projects for each course section, roughly half of  students will need to bring their own machine. The wifi network will be available during this course section. 

* **Your project must be completed independently.** While you may discuss, brainstorm, beta test, and advise one another, **all code _must_ be written by _you_, and _you alone_**. 

### Trade Show

Similar to team week in previous courses, you'll present your project in our in-class trade show. Take advantage of this opportunity to practice pitching your project and receive feedback on your MVP.

Plan to spend several minutes addressing the following:

*  **Project Name and Objective**: Why did you choose this project?  What purpose does it fulfill? 

*  **Demonstration**: Show and describe the features of your work. Use technical terms and try hard to make this a serious, professional presentation.

*  **Process**:  Describe the development process of your project. What was your MVP? What additional features did you add after fulfilling the requirements of your MVP? What features do you still hope to include? 

*  **Challenges**:  Share the biggest challenges you faced, and how you tackled them. 

Additionally, allow time for any questions your audience may have. 

**Your instructor has the final say on the length, timing, and structure of capstone presentations.** Check in with your instructor to learn about the plan for capstone presentations and follow any direction they give you.
