## Stories and Examples
<hr />

Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes much further in an interview than simply telling your interviewer you're good at something. For example, it's better to tell a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying "I'm good at problem-solving!"

Review the **STAR** method discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](/career-services/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere. It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
