## Independent Projects Overview

Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](/pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Functional Programming Project Objectives
---

This course section's independent project will be a little bit different than usual. Instead of applying your Functional JavaScript skills, you'll get a head-start on thinking about capstones. 

Capstone projects will appear later down the road - after the C# course - so it's normal to not have a clear idea of exactly what technology you might implement. However, this is a great time to start thinking about what you might want your capstone project to *accomplish*. 

A capstone is a project that you design and implement by yourself. In other educational sectors this may be called a thesis or a practicum. Your capstone project in this program will serve as the centerpiece of your coding portfolio that you will use in your job search. Compared to a required school project, a capstone project is more impressive to employers because it demonstrates what motivates you, your decision making skills, and your willingness to take intellectual risk. Capstone projects also tend to be more memorable because there are more opportunities to express your personality and you can plan a project around your interests. 

You may have never planned a project like this before. This is why Epicodus wants to start capstone planning early. Epicodus’s goal is to give you ample time to think, get feedback, and iterate on your capstone project before the start of the Capstone course. Project planning is a skill set, separate from coding, that becomes easier with experience. However, Epicodus doesn’t really teach project planning in the program because a junior developer is not generally expected to plan entire projects from scratch. So, this code review and future code reviews will provide direction to help you plan your project. Epicodus staff are also available for feedback and guidance.

During your normally scheduled independent project time, you will:

* Create one, or more, idea boards
* Create an outline explaining your chosen capstone idea, answering the following questions as a guide:
  * Who is this program built for?
  * What is the purpose of the program?
  * What is your end goal for this program?
  * Are there any roadblocks or issues you foresee with building this program?
  * If you were asked to begin working on this program now what would you start with?

Your submission will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* An idea board(s) to show us your thought process and what other project ideas you considered
* Includes a one page outline of capstone project.

It's alright to not stick to a specific idea if you find something more interesting, and it's alright to have more than one idea.

## Submission

Make sure to utilize GitHub to track the creation of your boards, and your capstone outline. Remember, you track image files, .pdf files, or whatever project file type you wish to use!

Submit your code for review to the **Functional Programming with JavaScript** code review on [Epicenter](https://epicenter.epicodus.com/).

Visit [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](/pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) for details on how to submit, how feedback works and course completion requirements.
