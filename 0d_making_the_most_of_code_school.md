You've done it, you're in code school! You've committed time, energy and dedication toward learning how to code. We can’t wait to see what you create and want to do everything we can to support your success. To be successful, it's important to consider how you can best approach the challenging six months that lie ahead.

First of all, this program is a marathon, not a sprint. Sometimes it will even feel like a slog. Sometimes concepts will make no sense, code will break for no reason that makes sense, and it will seem like nobody has the answer. In fact, that's a typical day in the life of a developer and one reason developers are in high demand and are paid well.

Epicodus will probably be very different than from your previous educational experiences. There are no shortcuts in our program. We need to have your full commitment in order to help make your own journey a success. It’s up to _you_ to make the most of your experience!
