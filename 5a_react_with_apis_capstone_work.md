There is no code review to submit for this course section. Instead, you will be expected to work on your capstone which should clearly be documented in your commit history:

  *  For full-time students, we require **8 hours** of work. 
  *  For part-time students, we require **4 hours** of work. 

When you turn in your capstone at the end of the program, your commit history will be checked to ensure that you put in the required work hours. 

**In total, you will be expected to put at least 40 hours of work into your capstone** during the time we provide you to work on your project in class and in lieu of regular independent projects for certain course sections. If you have any questions about this, check in with your instructor.

**For full-time students**, this includes the work you did for the React with Redux and React with NoSQL code reviews, the work that you do this Friday, and the work that you do during class next week. 

**For part-time students**, this includes the work you did for the React with Redux and React with NoSQL code reviews, the work that you do over this coming weekend, and the work that you in the last two weeks of class dedicated to your capstone. 

You are welcome to put in more work if you like. Remember that this project should be a foundational portfolio piece that can help lead to a job. Use your time wisely!
